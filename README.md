# Just Breathe
### Description
Have you ever found yourself stuck in a contaminated lab, as soon as you woke up from a 20 year cryo sleep? If not, then you have the opportunity to experience that in this top-down adventure-puzzle game.
Just Breathe features the adventures of Mask Imillian, a radio-technician who took the risk and volunteered to be the first person to be put in cryo sleep for 20 whole years. He wakes up in the year 2060,
just to be faced with a world filled with poisonous gas, that made the air unbreatheable. Luckily, a portion of the lab he was sleeping in hasn't been affected, offering him a chance to salvation.
